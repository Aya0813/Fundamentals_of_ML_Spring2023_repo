# Fundamentals of Machine Learning â€“ Spring 2023

This repository contains all coursework and the final capstone project from the **Fundamentals of Machine Learning** course, taken during **Spring 2023** at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU, New York City](https://cims.nyu.edu/), as part of my **study away semester** in the third year of my **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi**.

The course was taught by **Professor Pascal Wallisch** and covered a broad range of machine learning concepts, from foundational supervised learning algorithms to more advanced techniques in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

The repository is organized into:

* **Capstone Project** â€“ *Spotify Music Genre Classifier*: an end-to-end ML pipeline for classifying 50,000 songs into different music genres via the Spotify API. 
* **6 Homework Assignments** â€“ each covering a distinct ML topic, including data preprocessing, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
  Both **reports** (PDF) and **Jupyter Notebooks** are included for every assignment.
